### **Design**
As the central theme of the website is sailing, I made all my design choices based on nautical colours & elements.
I researched images and websites of boats, sailing and yachts to get inspiration for the colour scheme.

#### Fonts
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom") Google fonts: Roboto") font. This font is modern and easily readable.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I used icons from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons that were used were are all nautical themed or used to give meaning to a certain section.

<a></a>
#### Colours
The colour scheme is based on nautical and sailing colours. I wanted it to feel modern and clean. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to map out my colour scheme.

Colour Palette:
![Color Palette](assets/wireframes/colour-palette-voyager.png)

* #163A51: This dark blue colour is the primary colour for all headings and text. It is also the background of the main call to actions, check buttons and footer background.
* #F7B045: This is a yellow-orange colour used as an accent colour including the start button, the buy buttons and the clear/reset button.
* #2FA59E: This is a sea-green used minimally as a secondary colour for the icons in the About section.
* #F0F1F2: This is an off white/grey colour used for background blocks to break the website into sections. 
* #AAAAA: This is a light grey colour used for special icons. 

I used [Accessible Colors](https://accessible-colors.com/ "Accessible Colors") to make sure the colours in the design is at least AA compliant.

<a></a>
#### Logo
I designed the logo using an icon from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva")

![Logo](assets/wireframes/voyager-logo-design.png)

<a></a>
## **Wireframes**
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create low-fidelity wireframes and used [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/xd.html) to create medium-fidelity wireframes.
First I created a basic wireframe for mobile, for tablet and desktop. 
For my website, I have decided to go for a 1-page website which suits more with the current trends. 
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page. I have included a scroll-up button for user convenience.
